# CUTpoints
Conjugate Unscented Transform points

The matlab files provided generate the CUT points. Please see MAIN.m to generate the points of moment orders 4,6 and 8 for the dimensions described in the script. Alternatively, the points are already generated and saved in .mat files(loaded directly into matlab) in the folder "CUT points- mat files". The Gaussian CUT points are in the folder "CUTpoints/CUT points- mat files/gaussian_mat/CUT/". The .mat files are named as "cut6_7D_gaussian.mat" which imples -->  upto 6th order moments in 7 dimensions.
